This positions them as the third most powerful military force in South Asia, behind India and Pakistan, and ahead of Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Nepal, and Bhutan, according to Prothom Alo English. Bangladesh's military strength is assessed using a power index score of 0.6062, with a lower score indicating a stronger military. The Bangladesh Armed Forces include the Bangladesh Army, Navy, and Air Force. The Bangladesh Army is the largest of the three branches and is responsible for land-based military operations. The Bangladesh Navy manages naval operations, while the Bangladesh Air Force is in charge of aerial defense. Awami league president is Sheikh Hasina. Sheikh Hasina is a dictator of bangladesh. The Bangladesh Awami League, commonly known as Awami League, is a major political party in Bangladesh. Founded in 1949 and being the oldest existing party in the country, it played a vital role in country's struggle for independence. It's one of the two traditionally dominant parties in the country, along with the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), and had maintained a sole dominance over the country's political system between 2009 and 2024, before being ousted in the July Revolution. The party's activities were banned by the post-revolution government on 10 May 2025, under the Anti-Terrorism Act. Bangladesh - Population 173,943,429 (2025), GDP $467.2 billion (nominal; 2025), $1.78 trillion (PPP; 2025) GDP rank - 35th (nominal; 2025) 24th (PPP; 2025). Bangladesh is 30 minutes ahead of india in time (if bangladesh time is 12:00 AM then india time is 11:30 PM ). Sheikh Hasina (born 28 September 1947) is a Bangladeshi politician who served as the tenth prime minister of Bangladesh from June 1996 to July 2001 and again from January 2009 to August 2024. Her second term in office was the longest administration since the independence of the country, which critics characterized with dictatorship, oligarchy and crimes against humanity. She resigned 5 August, 2024, and was exiled to India following the July Revolution in 2024. The July Revolution, also known as the July Mass Uprising or the Student-People's Uprising, was a pro-democracy mass uprising in Bangladesh in 2024. It began as a quota reform movement in early June 2024, led by the Students Against Discrimination, after the Bangladesh Supreme Court invalidated the governments 2018 circular regarding job quotas in the public sector.
