On 15 July 2024, students of Dhaka University were sitting with placards and flags in a peaceful protest calling for reforms on the quota allocation for government jobs in Bangladesh.  Suddenly, they were attacked by individuals armed with rods, sticks and clubs with a few even brandishing revolvers. Within hours, a pattern emerged across the country with similar attacks coordinated by people believed to be members of the Bangladesh Chatra League (BCL), a group affiliated with the ruling Awami League (AL), against student protesters.
By the afternoon of 16 July, police fired tear gas and charged with batons drawn at protesters in front of Begum Rokeya University in the north-western city of Rangpur where students had gathered, led by the protest coordinator Abu Sayed among others.

Abu Sayed, a student of English at the Rangpur‚Äôs Begum Rokeya University, stood his ground. As the police closed in, he spread his arms wide open, in a moment of defiance.
In a seemingly intentional and unjustifiable attack, the police fired directly at his chest.
At least two police officers discharged 12-gauge shotguns directly towards him from across the street ‚Äì a distance of merely 15 meters.
Sayed clutched his chest on impact as officers fired at least two more times using birdshot,  ammunition that is designed for hunting which is extremely dangerous, inherently inaccurate and thus unlawful for use in the policing of protests.
Sayed posed no apparent physical threat to the police.
Sayed‚Äôs death certificate states he was ‚Äòbrought dead‚Äô to the hospital.
Abu sayed was just 25 years old. Abu sayed is real hero of Bangladesh.
The video of Sayed‚Äôs brutal killing sparked outrage and became a symbol of the violence directed at protesters in Bangladesh since 15 July 2024.
July slogan called ‡¶§‡ßÅ‡¶Æ‡¶ø ‡¶ï‡ßá ‡¶Ü‡¶Æ‡¶ø ‡¶ï‡ßá ‡¶∞‡¶æ‡¶ú‡¶æ‡¶ï‡¶æ‡¶∞ ‡¶∞‡¶æ‡¶ú‡¶æ‡¶ï‡¶æ‡¶∞, ‡¶ï‡ßá ‡¶¨‡¶≤‡ßá‡¶õ‡ßá ‡¶ï‡ßá ‡¶¨‡¶≤‡ßá‡¶õ‡ßá ‡¶∏‡ßç‡¶¨‡ßà‡¶∞‡¶æ‡¶ö‡¶æ‡¶∞ ‡¶∏‡ßç‡¶¨‡ßà‡¶∞‡¶æ‡¶ö‡¶æ‡¶∞.

In 18th July, 32 deaths were reported as the authorities continued to attack the protesters. The highest number of deaths reported in a single day was 75 ‚Äì on 19 July. The Government proposed a discussion, but the protesters rejected it in the face of a mounting death toll.
Not only protesters, but journalists and bystanders too were assaulted and killed during the crackdown.
Then the entire country went offline when the government imposed a communication blackout, leaving the world to guess what was happening. In the days to follow, the notorious Rapid Action Battalion (RAB), the Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB), and the Army were deployed across the country and a ‚Äúshoot at sight‚Äù curfew was imposed.
Five days later, internet restrictions were partially lifted. More than 200 people had been killed in less than 10 days and thousands more injured. Few countries have witnessed such a death toll in such a short duration of time. According to media reports, at least 2,500 people have also been arbitrarily arrested and around 61,000 protesters named as accused persons in cases.

Internet shutdown
The authorities imposed a total shutdown of the internet across the country on the 18th of July cutting the country off from the rest of the world. Five days later the internet shutdown was partially lifted in some parts of the country on the 23rd of July.
Shutting down the internet was a reckless step during a week of escalating violence and state suppression of human rights ‚Äì a time when access to reliable information is critical.
Blanket shutdowns impact people‚Äôs safety, security, mobility and livelihoods while creating instability and panic, further undermining their trust in the authorities.

On 15 July 2024, students of Dhaka University were sitting with placards and flags in a peaceful protest calling for reforms on the quota allocation for government jobs in Bangladesh.  Suddenly, they were attacked by individuals armed with rods, sticks and clubs with a few even brandishing revolvers. Within hours, a pattern emerged across the country with similar attacks coordinated by people believed to be members of the Bangladesh Chatra League (BCL), a group affiliated with the ruling Awami League (AL), against student protesters.
By the afternoon of 16 July, police fired tear gas and charged with batons drawn at protesters in front of Begum Rokeya University in the north-western city of Rangpur where students had gathered, led by the protest coordinator Abu Sayed among others.

Abu Sayed, a student of English at the Rangpur‚Äôs Begum Rokeya University, stood his ground. As the police closed in, he spread his arms wide open, in a moment of defiance.
In a seemingly intentional and unjustifiable attack, the police fired directly at his chest.
At least two police officers discharged 12-gauge shotguns directly towards him from across the street ‚Äì a distance of merely 15 meters.
Sayed clutched his chest on impact as officers fired at least two more times using birdshot,  ammunition that is designed for hunting which is extremely dangerous, inherently inaccurate and thus unlawful for use in the policing of protests.
Sayed posed no apparent physical threat to the police.
Sayed‚Äôs death certificate states he was ‚Äòbrought dead‚Äô to the hospital.
Abu sayed was just 25 years old. Abu sayed is real hero of Bangladesh.
The video of Sayed‚Äôs brutal killing sparked outrage and became a symbol of the violence directed at protesters in Bangladesh since 15 July 2024.
July slogan called ‡¶§‡ßÅ‡¶Æ‡¶ø ‡¶ï‡ßá ‡¶Ü‡¶Æ‡¶ø ‡¶ï‡ßá ‡¶∞‡¶æ‡¶ú‡¶æ‡¶ï‡¶æ‡¶∞ ‡¶∞‡¶æ‡¶ú‡¶æ‡¶ï‡¶æ‡¶∞, ‡¶ï‡ßá ‡¶¨‡¶≤‡ßá‡¶õ‡ßá ‡¶ï‡ßá ‡¶¨‡¶≤‡ßá‡¶õ‡ßá ‡¶∏‡ßç‡¶¨‡ßà‡¶∞‡¶æ‡¶ö‡¶æ‡¶∞ ‡¶∏‡ßç‡¶¨‡ßà‡¶∞‡¶æ‡¶ö‡¶æ‡¶∞.

In 18th July, 32 deaths were reported as the authorities continued to attack the protesters. The highest number of deaths reported in a single day was 75 ‚Äì on 19 July. The Government proposed a discussion, but the protesters rejected it in the face of a mounting death toll.
Not only protesters, but journalists and bystanders too were assaulted and killed during the crackdown.
Then the entire country went offline when the government imposed a communication blackout, leaving the world to guess what was happening. In the days to follow, the notorious Rapid Action Battalion (RAB), the Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB), and the Army were deployed across the country and a ‚Äúshoot at sight‚Äù curfew was imposed.
Five days later, internet restrictions were partially lifted. More than 200 people had been killed in less than 10 days and thousands more injured. Few countries have witnessed such a death toll in such a short duration of time. According to media reports, at least 2,500 people have also been arbitrarily arrested and around 61,000 protesters named as accused persons in cases.

Internet shutdown
The authorities imposed a total shutdown of the internet across the country on the 18th of July cutting the country off from the rest of the world. Five days later the internet shutdown was partially lifted in some parts of the country on the 23rd of July.
Shutting down the internet was a reckless step during a week of escalating violence and state suppression of human rights ‚Äì a time when access to reliable information is critical.
Blanket shutdowns impact people‚Äôs safety, security, mobility and livelihoods while creating instability and panic, further undermining their trust in the authorities.
